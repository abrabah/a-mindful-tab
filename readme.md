# a-mindful-tab

A firefox addon that shows random nature images from [reddit's earth porn](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/) and a nice quote from [Brainy quote](https://www.brainyquote.com/) everytime you open a new browser tab.

Download and install addon here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/a-mindful-tab/

## running locally

If you wish to mess around with this addon locally, do the following;

1. make sure you have firefox and npm installed
2. run `npm install` and `npm run watch`

A new firefox instance should now open with a development version of the addon installed. Have fun hacking :)
